This is an aggregated list of many open source programs I've worked on, however most of them are
one-offs.

### Notch

[Notch](https://github.com/Reshurum/notch) is a CHIP-8 virtual machine written in Rust. I wrote it after getting
interested in emulation from the [Ferris Makes Emulators stream](https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff).
It has worked with all games I threw at it so far, but can use a little polishing and refactoring.

### LoL CSV

LoL CSV is a simple web application for League of Legends players wishing to track their match
stats. Given a summoner name, a spreadsheet is generated with match data from the previous 10
matches. You can find LoL CSV [here](https://lolcsv.com) and the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/StickmanVentures/lol-csv).

### Inquiry Bot

Inquiry Bot is a slackbot using Slack's webhook api that I created for the wonderful people at
[Stickman Ventures](https://www.stickmanventures.com/). It's purpose is to instantly post contact
information from the website directly to one of our slack channels through
[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). You can find Inquiry Bot on
[GitHub](https://github.com/StickmanVentures/inquiry-bot).
