Inquiry Bot is a slackbot using Slack's webhook api that I created for the wonderful people at
[Stickman Ventures](https://www.stickmanventures.com/). It's purpose is to instantly post contact
information from the website directly to one of our slack channels through
[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). You can find Inquiry Bot on
[GitHub](https://github.com/StickmanVentures/inquiry-bot).
