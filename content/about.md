Hello, I'm Walter. I'm a software engineer with an interest in web development
and some more esoteric things like emulator development. My interest in software
sparked from a natural curiosity of how things work, and it's what drives me to
learn new and amazing things.

If you want to see some of what I do, check out my [projects](/projects).
