Ginger is a morph target demo that was initially written in 2011 for chrome
experiments, and then rewritten to work as progressive web app in early 2016. In
essence, Ginger is a customizable head that uses a slider to tweak various
facial features, much like a character customization system one would find in a
video game. It also supports taking screenshots, and generating share links that
can be used to share your creation with others.
