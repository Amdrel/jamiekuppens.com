description: "Vercel previews offer a great way to test PRs for a project. They have a predefined environment and donâ€™t require any additional setup work from the reviewer to test changes quickly. Many projects also use end-to-end tests with Playwright as part of the review process to ensure that no regressions slip uncaught."
