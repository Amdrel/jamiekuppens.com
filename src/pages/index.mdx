# Hello! I'm Jamie

I am a fullstack software engineer based in California with over 10 years of experience building
performant experiences for the web. I am highly experienced in the backend having maintained REST
APIs, GraphQL APIs and microservices written with Node.js and Python; but also the frontend as well
with React, Next.js and Angular.

Currently I'm employed as a Senior Software Engineer at [This Dot](https://www.thisdot.co/) working
primarily on frontend creating performant and resilient experiences that users can count on. I've
had the opportunity to work on websites and services that receive millions of visitors from
marketing campaign landing pages to online ordering systems.

If you want to see some of what I've done, check out my [work experience](/work-experience) or [side
projects](/projects).

In my free time I am a D&D and RPG nerd that is seemingly incapable of playing anything that doesn't
have pointy ears. In-particular I'm currently a very active World of Warcraft player raiding with my
guild every week killing bosses and getting loot. As far as programming goes I have been getting
back into the side project groove again.
