  # Hello! I'm Jamie

  I am a fullstack software engineer based in California with over 10 years of experience building
  performant experiences for the web. I am highly experienced in the backend having maintained REST
  APIs, GraphQL APIs and microservices written with Node.js and Python; but also the frontend as well
  with React, Next.js and Angular.

  Currently I'm employed as a **Senior Software Engineer** at <a href="https://www.thisdot.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Dot</a>
  working primarily on frontend creating performant and resilient experiences that users can count on.
  I've had the opportunity to work on websites and services that receive millions of visitors from
  marketing campaign landing pages to online ordering systems.

  If you want to see some of what I've done, then feel free to check out my [work
  experience](#experience), [side projects](/projects) or [recent posts](#recent-posts).

  In my free time I am a D&D and RPG nerd that is seemingly incapable of playing anything that doesn't
  have pointy ears. In-particular I'm currently a very active World of Warcraft player raiding with my
  guild every week killing bosses and getting loot. As far as programming goes I have been getting
  back into the side project groove again.
