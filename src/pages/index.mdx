# Hello! I'm Jamie

I am a fullstack software developer based in California with over 10 years of experience building
performant experiences for the web. Currently I'm employed as a Senior Software Engineer at <a
href="https://www.thisdot.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Dot</a>.

I am experienced in the backend having maintained APIs and microservices written with Node.js, PHP,
and Python; but also the frontend as well with React, Next.js and Angular. I create performant and
resilient experiences that users can count on. I've had the opportunity to work on websites and
services from marketing campaign landing pages to online ordering systems.

If you want to see some of what I've done, then feel free to check out my [work
experience](/experience), [open source contributions](/open-source), or [recent posts](#recent-posts).

In my free time I am a D&D and RPG nerd that is seemingly incapable of playing anything that doesn't
have pointy ears. In-particular I'm currently a very active World of Warcraft player raiding with my
guild every week killing bosses and getting loot.
