# Open Source and Personal Projects

This is a list of notable open source projects, demos, and personal projects I've worked on over the
years. Most of my personal projects are one-offs and aren't actively maintained. This list is
non-comprehensive and is a showcase of the projects I consider the most interesting and relevant.

## Open Source Contributions

### Wikimedia

I've made several contributions to Wikimedia projects, primarily to extensions but also other
related community projects. Some notable contributions include the following:

- Helped implement multi-question surveys for the QuickSurveys extension with conditional flow and improved audience targeting.
- Streamlined the user vanishing process for both users and stewards.
- Contributed patches to several extensions to make them compatible with temporary accounts.
- Extended SecurePoll to support multiple tallies for more transparency if a tally must be redone.
- Contributed several features and bug fixes to Video2Commons.
- Implemented performance improvements and created management scripts for Wikilink.

## Demos

### Ginger

A _very_ long time ago when I joined Stickman Ventures they had an early WebGL demo hosted on
[Chrome Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ginger-facial-rigging) named
[Ginger](https://github.com/Amdrel/ginger) that utilized morph targets with
[three.js](https://threejs.org/). I didn't work on the initial implementation, however at some point
we determined that we wanted to open source the demo. Before doing so it was determined that we
would modernize it and make some performance improvements, and so I was tasked to
help with that.

Ginger is currently not hosted anywhere, but I might fix that soon considering that the source code
is open source. It's licensed under the Apache-2.0 license and the model assets are owned by [David
Steele](https://bsky.app/profile/bootstrapbuckaroo.bsky.social) (CC BY-NC 4.0).

## Personal Projects

### Lorewalker Cho

[Lorewalker Cho](https://github.com/amdrel/lorewalker-cho) is a fully functional Discord bot that
plays games where it asks trivia questions related to the game World of Warcraft. The bot is written
in Python 3 and uses the wonderful [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
and uses PostgreSQL as a backend for storing Discord server configurations and scoreboards.

It supports the following features:

- Allows setting custom trivia channels and prefixes (admin only).
- Is able to error correct misspelled words in answers.
- Keeps track of player scores in the Discord server.

I don't currently have this bot hosted anywhere since I'm not actively using it on any of my servers
at the moment. You will probably have to update `discord.py` to be able to use it since I'm sure
Discord has made some breaking changes since I've last used this.

### jamiekuppens.com

[jamiekuppens.com](https://github.com/Amdrel/jamiekuppens.com) is the website that you're on right
now! It was created with Astro and it uses a custom theme designed by myself. This website was
designed to be as small and fast as possible.

Previously this website was written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which I still adore, but I much
prefer using JSX for customizing my site instead of templates.

### Google Calendar Discord Syncer

[Google Calendar Discord Syncer](https://github.com/Amdrel/gcal-discord-poster) is an interactive
CLI application written in Python that syncs Google calendar events to a Discord server channel
using embeds. I wrote this a long time ago when Discord didn't support events yet so that I could
have nice looking signup posts for World of Warcraft raids events in my guild.

The other reason why I wrote this tool was because I got tired of copy-pasting event posts and
adjusting the times in them two times a week. However, I've since replaced it with [Raid
Helper](https://raid-helper.dev/) since it supports scheduling event posts while also automatically
changing the date.

### Notch

[Notch](https://github.com/amdrel/notch) is a CHIP-8 virtual machine written in Rust. I wrote it
after getting interested in emulation from the [Ferris Makes Emulators
stream](https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff). It has worked with all games I threw at it so
far, but can use a little polishing and refactoring.
