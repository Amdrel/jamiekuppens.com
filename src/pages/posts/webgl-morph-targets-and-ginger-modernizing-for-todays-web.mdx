description: "Ginger is a morph target demo that was initially written in 2011 for chrome experiments, and then rewritten to work as progressive web app in early 2016. In essence, Ginger is a customizable head that uses a slider to tweak various facial features, much like a character customization system one would find in a video game. It also supports taking screenshots, and generating share links that can be used to share your creation with others."
