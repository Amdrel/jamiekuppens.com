# Projects

This is a list of notable personal and open source projects I've worked on over the years. Most of
my personal projects are one-offs and aren't actively maintained. This list is non-comprehensive and
is a showcase of the projects I consider the most interesting and relevant.

## Personal Projects

### Lorewalker Cho

[Lorewalker Cho](https://github.com/amdrel/lorewalker-cho) is a fully functional Discord bot that
plays games where it asks trivia questions related to the game World of Warcraft. The bot is written
in Python 3 and uses the wonderful [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
and uses PostgreSQL as a backend for storing Discord server configurations and scoreboards.

It supports the following features:

- Allows setting custom trivia channels and prefixes (admin only).
- Is able to error correct misspelled words in answers.
- Keeps track of player scores in the Discord server.

I don't currently have this bot hosted anywhere since I'm not actively using it on any of my servers
at the moment. You will probably have to update `discord.py` to be able to use it since I'm sure
Discord has made some breaking changes since I've last used this.

Want to add questions to Lorewalker Cho? [Create an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/amdrel/lorewalker-cho/issues/new) and use the `question-request` label.
Include your question text, answer and topic of the question being submitted.

### jamiekuppens.com

[jamiekuppens.com](https://github.com/Amdrel/jamiekuppens.com) is the website that you're on right
now! It was created with Astro and it uses a custom theme designed by myself. This website was
designed to be as small and fast as possible.

Previously this website was written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which I still adore, but I much
prefer using JSX for customizing my site instead of templates.

### Google Calendar Discord Syncer

[Google Calendar Discord Syncer](https://github.com/Amdrel/gcal-discord-poster) is an interactive
CLI application written in Python that syncs Google calendar events to a Discord server channel
using embeds. I wrote this a long time ago when Discord didn't support events yet so that I could
have nice looking signup posts for World of Warcraft raids events in my guild.

The other reason why I wrote this tool was because I got tired of copy-pasting event posts and
adjusting the times in them two times a week. However, I've since replaced it with [Raid
Helper](https://raid-helper.dev/) since it supports scheduling event posts while also automatically
changing the date.

### Notch

[Notch](https://github.com/amdrel/notch) is a CHIP-8 virtual machine written in Rust. I wrote it
after getting interested in emulation from the [Ferris Makes Emulators
stream](https://www.twitch.tv/ferrisstreamsstuff). It has worked with all games I threw at it so
far, but can use a little polishing and refactoring.

## Open Source Contributions

### Wikimedia

I've made several contributions to Wikimedia projects, primarily to extensions but also other
related community projects. Some notable contributions include the following:

* Helped implement multi-question surveys with conditional flow and improved audience targeting.
* Streamlined the user vanishing process for both users and stewards.
* Submitted patches to several extensions to make them more compatible with temporary accounts.
* Extended SecurePoll to support multiple tallies for more transparency if a tally must be redone.
* Contributed several features and bug fixes to Video2Commons.
* Implemented performance improvements and created management scripts for Wikilink.
